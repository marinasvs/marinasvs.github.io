Welcome to my website! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the European University Institute ([EUI](https://eui.eu/economics)).

I study how technology and innovation affect the financial markets using industrial organization tools. My supervisors are [Giacomo Calzolari](https://sites.google.com/view/giacomo-calzolari) and [Thomas Crossley](https://sites.google.com/site/tfcrossley/). 

From April to September 2022, I am visiting the Bank for International Settlements ([BIS](https://bis.org)) as a Ph.D. Fellow.
