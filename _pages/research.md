### Technology and Credit Market Information Asymmetries

This paper studies how technological improvements shape credit market outcomes, focusing on how technology helps lenders alleviate two information asymmetries: adverse selection and moral hazard. I model an economy with asymmetric information about borrowers' creditworthiness and about borrowersâ€™ effort to repay a loan. Tech-lenders have a better technology for screening creditworthiness and for monitoring effort. Borrowers, however, have a preference for lenders that monitor less. The trade-off I explore is the following: for the same interest rate, borrowers prefer to contract with the traditional bank, since it monitors them less; but thanks to the screening asymmetry, the tech-lender can sometimes offer lower interest rates. Borrowers' preference for a less intrusive monitor determines which market structure arises in equilibrium. Furthermore, I derive bounds and provide comparative statics to understand how these two forces impact credit market outcomes.
