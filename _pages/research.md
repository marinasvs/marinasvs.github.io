### Technology and Credit Market Information Asymmetries

This project explores the impact that technologically oriented lenders have on the credit market information asymmetries. New to other studies in the literature, I employ a differentiated products approach, where differentiation comes on the basis of a preference for lower monitoring. The preference for lower monitoring decreases the informational advantage coming from better screening and implies that the more technologically enabled player may not always have a market presence if its technology is too intrusive.
